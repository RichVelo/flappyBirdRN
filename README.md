Following along with a tutorial to have a crack at React-native

Set up using expo (https://expo.dev)

[ I had issues installing expo - but I found this commend: sudo npm install --unsafe-perm -g expo-cli (https://github.com/expo/expo-cli/discussions/590) which worked]

I was then able to use expo init my-project-name

and because im using npm - npm start - this allows me to preview the app by browser and my phone

The metro bundler appears to have been deprecated so the terminal QR code was used to allow me to use my phone to preview the app with the Expo Go app in iOS.
